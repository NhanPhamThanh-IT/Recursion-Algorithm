# <div align="center">Difference Between Recursion And Induction</div>

Recursion and induction are fundamental ideas in computer science and mathematics that might be regularly used to solve problems regarding repetitive structures. Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve the problem, whilst induction is a mathematical proof technique used to establish the fact of an infinite collection of statements. Understanding the differences between these two ideas is essential for grasping their applications and boundaries.

## What is Recursion?

Recursion is a process in which a function gets repeated again and again until some base function is satisfied. It repeats and uses its previous values to form a sequence. The procedure applies a certain relation to the given function again and again until some base condition is met. It consists of two components:

- __Base Condition__: In order to stop a recursive function, a condition is needed. This is known as a base condition. Base condition is very important. If the base condition is missing from the code then the function can enter into an infinite loop.
- __Recursive Step__: It divides a big problem into small instances that are solved by the recursive function and later on recombined in the results.

Let a(1), a(2), ... a(n) be a sequence. The recursive formula is given by:

```
a(n) = a(n-1) + a(1)
```

__For example__

```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Where F(0) = 0
```

### How to Perform Recursion? 

Suppose the function given is:

```
T(n) = T(n-1) + C
```

We first use the given base condition. Let us denote base condition by T0, n= 2. we will find T1. C is the constant.

```
T(n) = T(n-1) + C // n = 2
T(2) = T(2-1) + C
T(1) = T(1-1) + C

Therefor:
T(2) = T(0) + C + C // Base condition achieved, recursion terminates.
```

## What is Induction?

Induction is the branch of mathematics that is used to prove a result, or a formula, or a statement, or a theorem. It is used to establish the validity of a theorem or result. It has two working rules:

- __Base Step__: It helps us to prove that the given statement is true for some initial value. 
- __Inductive Step__: It states that if the theorem is true for the nth term, then the statement is true for (n+1)th term. 

__Example__: The assertion is that the nth Fibonacci number is at most 2^n. 

### How to Prove a Statement Using Induction? 

- __Step 1__: Prove or verify that the statement is true for n=1
- __Step 2__: Assume that the statement is true for n=k
- __Step 3__: Verify that the statement is true for n=k+1, then it can be concluded that the statement is true for n.

## Conclusion

Recursion and induction, even though carefully associated, serve different functions: recursion in algorithm design and induction in mathematical proofs. Recognizing their distinctions helps in efficiently applying every concept to the right context, whether in coding recursive algorithms or proving statements using mathematical induction.

## Frequently Asked Questions on Recursion and Induction â€“ FAQs

### Can induction be used to prove the correctness of recursive algorithms?

> Yes, induction is regularly used to prove the correctness of recursive algorithms with the help of showing that the algorithm works for a base case and that, assuming it really works for an arbitrary case, it also works for the next case.

### Why is mathematical induction essential?

> Mathematical induction is essential for proving the correctness of algorithms, in particular for the ones involving loops or recursion, and for establishing the validity of statements across an infinite set.

### Can recursion be used without induction?

> Yes, recursion may be used independently in programming to resolve the issues, despite the fact that induction can assist in reasoning about and proving the correctness of recursive algorithms.

# Delete a linked list using recursion

Delete the given linked list using recursion.

### Method

1. If head equal to NULL then linked list is empty, we simply return. 
2. Recursively delete linked list after head node. 
3. Delete head node. 

### Complexity Analysis

__Time Complexity__: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the given linked list.

__Auxiliary Space__: O(N) due to recursion call stack.

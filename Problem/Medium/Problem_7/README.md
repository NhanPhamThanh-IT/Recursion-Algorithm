# Programs for Printing Pyramid Patterns using Recursion

This article is aimed at giving a recursive implementation for pattern printing.

### Table Of Content

- __Simple triangle pattern__
- __After 180-degree rotation__
- __Printing pyramid__
- __Number pattern__
- __Numbers without reassigning__
- __Character pattern__
- __Continuous character pattern__

### Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity and Space Complexity of the above Programs

- __Time Complexity__: O(n2)

- __Auxiliary Space__: O(n2), due to recursion stack.
